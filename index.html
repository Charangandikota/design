<h1>Online Courses: Strategies
for Success</h1>

    </center>
<p>A number of post-secondary institutions are looking more seriously at
offering online courses to meet the educational needs of a fast-paced,
computer-literate society.</p>
<p>In 1998, Macon State College (MSC) began offering an online Business
Computer Applications course, and since its inception, approximately 250
students have enrolled in the 16-week (one-semester) course. Business
Computer Applications provides instruction in basic computer concepts and
terminology as well as instruction using the software program, Microsoft
Office. It is one of the core courses required of all business majors; however,
many other students also enroll in the class.</p>
<p>This chapter provides instructors who are interested in offering online
classes with various strategies used and found successful in the instruction of
an online Business Computer Applications course. Topics such as the
importance of an initial class meeting, providing diverse instructional materials, the value of student course evaluations, and the dilemma of student assessment procedures will be addressed</p>
<p>Although a course management system (CMS) is used to manage the
online Business Computer Applications course discussed in this chapter,

<p>With working adults becoming an increasingly large percentage of the
college population and with greater numbers of students having computer and
Internet experience prior to entering college, a number of post-secondary
institutions are looking more seriously at offering online instruction to meet
students’ educational needs.</p>

<p>Although a course management system (CMS) is used to manage the
online Business Computer Applications course discussed in this chapter,
many of the procedures incorporated can be effective in the facilitation of any
online course. The advantages of using a CMS to implement and manage
online courses will also be discussed later in this chapter.</p>
 <center><h1>PLANNING THE ONLINE COURSE</h1></center>
<p>Online instruction can be offered in a variety of formats, and the
process selected by instructors will depend on such factors as whether they
are encouraged and supported by the administration, have the technological infrastructure available at their school to support online instruction,
have access to technical support, or have technical knowledge and expertise themselves.</p>
<p>Once a decision is made regarding the technological format that will be
used, the instructor can begin with the course design and planning and
developing the course. During the planning stage, it is important that the
instructor define course goals and objectives, identify interaction procedures
to be used in the class, decide on instructional materials or course content, and
determine how the course content will be organized and made available to
students online (Cooper, 1999).</p>
<p>Implementation considerations by the instructor include such decisions
as how to introduce students to the logistics of online learning, how to
evaluate students on their understanding of course content and achievement
of course objectives, how students will evaluate the effectiveness of online
instruction, and how to continually improve the online course and the online
learning process (Cooper, 1999).</p>
<center><h2>Business Computer Applications Background</h2></center>
<p>In 1998, Macon State College (MSC) began offering an online
Business Computer Applications course, and since its inception, about
250 students have enrolled in the 16-week (one-semester) course. Approximately 20-25 students enroll in each of the online sections of the
course. By limiting the number of students in the course, the instructor is
better able to interact with all class members and will minimize the need
for logistical support.</p>
<p>Business Computer Applications provides instruction in basic computer
concepts and terminology as well as instruction using the software program,
Microsoft Office. It is one of the core courses required of all business majors;
however, many other students also enroll in the class.</p>
<p>In the past, the course has been taught only in the traditional format. Class
activities included instructor lecture, student discussion, instructor demonstration, hands-on computer activities, etc., and although numerous sections
of the class are still taught in this traditional format, online sections are offered
as well. The online classes provide those students who may already be familiar
with the course material, who find it difficult to attend classes on campus
because of work or home scheduling conflicts, or who are motivated and able
to manage their time effectively the opportunity to complete the class
somewhat independently.</p>
<p>ewhat independently.
Enrollment in the online Business Computer Applications course requires that students have a 2.5 grade point average, Internet access, and access to a computer equipped with Microsoft Office software. Online students
attend an initial class meeting or orientation session, during which they meet
the instructor and each other and have the opportunity to ask questions.</p>
<p>Because the course provides instruction in theory (computer theory and
concepts) and computer software applications (Microsoft Office), two textbooks are used. The theory book contains eight chapters and covers topics
such as the history of computing; the design, function, and relationships
between internal components of a computer; how data is processed and stored
internally and externally; the effect of computers on society; and how to
purchase computer hardware and software. Students are responsible forapproximately one chapter per week and are tested after every two chapters.These exams are generally objective in nature, administered online, and
graded automatically. Students take them on an assigned day but at a time
convenient to them. When finished with the exams, students can see the
correct answer to each of the questions, as well as their test grade. Students
also take a comprehensive final exam over the theory textbook.</p>
<p>The Microsoft Office textbook is divided into six sections. Students learn
how to work and manage files in the Windows environment (one-two weeks);
how to use the Internet for communicating and research (one week); and how
to use the software applications, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft
Access (three weeks each), and Microsoft PowerPoint (one week). To help
them with learning each of the applications, they have a CD-ROM tutorial and
access to online videos in addition to step-by-step instructions provided in the
textbook.</p>
<p>Students report to campus three times during the semester to take tests
over the software applications. They are also required to research a business
technology topic using the Internet and then write a research paper and create
a PowerPoint presentation on that topic.</p>
<h2>Student Profile</h2>
<p>During the 1999-2000 academic year, the average student enrolled in the
online Business Computer Applications course was 27 years in age, female
(61%), and employed. In fact, of the online students, 56% were employed fulltime, 28% were employed part-time, and 16% were unemployed. In most cases, the unemployed student was a stay-at-home mother with children.</p>
<p>In comparison, the average student enrolled in the traditional class during
the 1999-2000 academic year was 23 years of age, also female (64%), and
employed part-time. Of traditional students, 66% were employed part-time,
33%were employed full-time, and 7% were unemployed. Thus, the biggest
difference between students enrolled in the online class and the traditional
class was employment status (Cooper, 2001).</p>
<h2></h2>
<p>Because online learning is a new experience for most students, an initial
class meeting is beneficial. It provides an excellent opportunity for students
to meet the instructor and each other, ask questions, and become acquainted
with course logistics (Cooper, 1999). Students also need to be aware of the
hardware and software that they will need as well as the level of computing
proficiency required (Hanna et al., 2000).</p>
<p>During the class meeting, it is helpful to go over information typically
covered the first day of a regular class such as syllabus, textbook, instructor
office hours, testing procedures, etc. In addition to the syllabus, one of the
most beneficial handouts to both students and the instructor is the semester
calendar (also available online), which includes a timeline or schedule of
activities, assignments, and test dates for each week of the semester. Not only
does the schedule provide students with a weekly “to do” list, but it also
reminds students of their learning objectives and keeps both the students and
the instructor on task.</p>
<p>The initial meeting also furnishes students with an explanation of what
an online course is, the role of the instructor in the online classroom, student
expectations, and the mechanics of how “everything works.” Because the
instructor has access to the student roster prior to this meeting, it is advantageous to enter all user names into the system beforehand. Doing so allows
students during this class session to log on with their assigned user name and
password and actually navigate the course website and become familiar with
the content and the various online features.</p>
<p>The opportunity for students to actually log onto the course website and
become familiar with it helps answer any questions they might have and
alleviates any anxieties that they might be experiencing. An introduction to
the online course content can also prevent students when later working on
their own from wasting time and becoming “frustrated with the system to the
point where they abandon it and any subsequent attempts to master its
content” (Bayram, 1999).</p>
<p>Given that the majority of problems students encounter are computerrelated, it is also helpful to spend time during the initial class meeting
demonstrating proper installation of the tutorial CD-ROM, downloading and
installing video player software, running a PowerPoint presentation on the
Internet, and sending and receiving attachments.</p>
<p>Since students tend to forget some of the information presented during the
session, a “FAQ” or “frequently asked questions” link is added to the course
homepage. This page provides answers to such questions as “How do I send an
attachment?” “How do I install course software?” and “How do I get started in the
course?” Should they need additional assistance with any of these operations,
students are encouraged to visit the campus lab or contact the instructor.</p>
<p>It is also helpful during the initial class session to have students complete
a survey or profile sheet. The information provided by them can be helpful in
determining their learning needs and for providing them with diverse instructional materials. It can also help students assess their readiness for onlinelearning (Hanna et al., 2000).</p>
<p>In addition, because students who miss the orientation session are more
likely to drop the course, the entire session is videotaped and made available
to them—both in the library and online.</p>
<p>When it is not possible to provide an initial class meeting for an online
class, other strategies can be utilized. Prior to the beginning of class, the
instructor can send students a letter or email introducing him/herself, welcoming students to the class, furnishing them the URL or online course
website address, providing instructions for accessing the online learning
materials, and highlighting specific online features or Web pages. Although
the syllabus and course schedule are both provided online, it is helpful to also
include them with the letter.</p>
<p>this first written communication, it is also helpful if students are asked
to communicate with the instructor during the first week of class either
through email or telephone to ensure that they understand the content
organization and their expectations as online students.</p>
<h2>Online Communication</h2>
<h3>Instructor-Student Communication</h3>
<p>To maintain regular instructor-student communication, it is beneficial to
send students a class announcement every week that provides an overview of
the upcoming week’s activities, provides any additional information or
explanations about course content or assignments, reminds them of test dates,
and addresses any student concerns expressed to the instructor during the
previous week.</p>
<p>To encourage discussion of course content and interaction of ideas in the
Business Computer Applications course, the instructor posts content-related
topics regularly. Discussion questions should require thought, problem
solving, and/or research but should be brief, as students are more likely to
participate if the topic is concise and does not require lengthy responses.
Participation is a part of the students’ final grades, and although they are
graded on the frequency of their participation, they are also graded on the
quality of their input. Extra credit points are given to students who take the
initiative to begin their own discussion of ideas and/or opinions.</p>
